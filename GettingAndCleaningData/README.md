#Data Getting and Cleaning Project Files

The meaning of the files in this folder is:

* HAR_Tidy.txt :            is the tidy data set required by the assignment
* Aggregated_HAR_Tidy.txt : is the other data set with the averages
* run_analysis.R :          is the code used to create those files based on the data set in * the folder UCI HAR Dataset

You can open the files HAR_Tidy.txt and Aggregated_HAR_Tidy.txt using the function read.csv from the default R package.

All files in the folder UCI HAR Dataset were downloaded from [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones/ "UCI Machine Learning Repository").
